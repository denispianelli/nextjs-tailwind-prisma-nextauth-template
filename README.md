#### Nodemailer

- Get the app password from your Gmail account:

To get an App Password for your Gmail account, follow these detailed steps:

Note: You‚Äôll need to have two-step verification enabled on your Gmail account before generating an App Password. If you haven‚Äôt enabled it, do so first by going to your Google Account settings.

1. Access Your Google Account:
2. Start by visiting the [Google Account management page](https://myaccount.google.com).
3. **Sign In:** Sign in to the Google Account associated with the Gmail address you want to use for sending emails programmatically.
4. **Security:** In the left sidebar, click on ‚ÄúSecurity.‚Äù
5. Scroll down to How you sign in to google and click on 2-step verificaiton.
6. **App Passwords:** Scroll down to ‚ÄúApp passwords.‚Äù Click on ‚ÄúApp passwords.‚Äù You may be prompted to re-enter your password for security purposes.
7. **App name:** Enter a custom name for this App Password. It helps you identify it later, so choose something related to the application or use case where you plan to use this App Password.
8. **Create:** Click the ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù button. Google will create a unique 16-character App Password for your custom application/device.

Once generated, Google will display the App Password on the screen. Important:
This is the only time you‚Äôll see this password. Make sure to save it securely
because you won‚Äôt be able to view it again. You‚Äôll use this App Password in your
application code to authenticate with Gmail‚Äôs SMTP server.

For example:

```js
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=465
EMAIL_SERVER_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=your.email@gmail.com
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=your secret app password
EMAIL_FROM=your.email@gmail.com
```
